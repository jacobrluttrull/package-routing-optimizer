# ðŸ“¦ Package Routing Optimizer (WGUPS Project)

## Overview
This project simulates a **delivery routing system** for the Western Governors University Parcel Service (WGUPS).  
It calculates the most efficient routes for three delivery trucks under constraints such as deadlines, delayed packages, and grouped deliveries.  

The program demonstrates skills in **data structures, algorithms, and optimization** by implementing a custom **chaining hash table** and a **greedy nearest-neighbor algorithm** to minimize total mileage.

## âœ¨ Features
- Custom **hash table** for fast package lookups (O(1) average case).
- Route optimization with a **greedy nearest-neighbor algorithm**.
- Handles real-world delivery constraints:
  - Delayed package availability
  - Must-be-delivered-together packages
  - Deadline-sensitive deliveries
- Tracks total mileage, truck routes, and delivery times.
- Interactive CLI menu for querying package status.
